# Algorithms and Data Structures [Java]

Here you can find algorithms implemented in Java.
These implementations are intended for learning purposes only.

You can run, clone or propose your implementation.

1. Arrays and LinkedList
2. Recursion and DP
3. Trees and Graphs
4. Stack/Queue/Dequeue 
5. Sorting algorithms

I keep updating the repository with new problems.
